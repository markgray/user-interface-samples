    /**
     * Called when the activity is starting. First we call our super's implementation of `onCreate`,
     * then we set our content view to our layout file `R.layout.activity_main`. It consists of a
     * [CoordinatorLayout] root view (a super-powered `FrameLayout`)
     * which includes the layout file `R.layout.bottom_sheet_font_query` (which is a A `FrameLayout`
     * with a rounded corner background and shadow) whose app:layout_behavior attribute is
     * [com.google.android.material.bottomsheet.BottomSheetBehavior] (ie. a bottom sheet with a peek
     * height of 120dp which can come up from the bottom of the screen, elevated over the main content.
     * It can be dragged vertically to expose more or less of its content) which holds a
     * [androidx.core.widget.NestedScrollView] holding all of the controls used to select and
     * configure the font to be requested. `R.layout.activity_main` also contains a `LinearLayout`
     * holding a [TextView] which displays sample text whose typeface is changed when a new font is
     * downloaded, and a [ProgressBar] used to display the progress of the font download.
     *
     * Having set our content view we next call our [initializeSeekBars] method to have it locate
     * and configure all of the [SeekBar] controls used to change the characteristics of the font
     * we want to download.
     *
     * We initialize our [ArraySet] field [mFamilyNameSet] with a new instance then add all of the
     * strings in the `R.array.family_names` string array resource to it (our method [isValidFamilyName]
     * uses this [ArraySet] to verify that the font name the user chooses is a valid font name).
     *
     * Next we initialize our [TextView] field [mDownloadableFontTextView] by finding the view with
     * ID `R.id.textview` (contains the sample text whose typeface will be changed to use the font
     * that is downloaded). We initialize our [ArrayAdapter] variable `val adapter` to an instance
     * which uses the layout file with ID [android.R.layout.simple_dropdown_item_1line] when
     * instantiating views, and the string array whose resource ID is `R.array.family_names` as the
     * objects to represent in the ListView. We initialize our [TextInputLayout] variable
     * `val familyNameInput` by finding the view with ID `R.id.auto_complete_family_name_input`
     * (it is a Layout which wraps a [AutoCompleteTextView] to show a floating label when the hint
     * is hidden while the user inputs text, and is used to display an error message if the user
     * tries to choose an invalid font). We initialize our [AutoCompleteTextView] variable
     * `val autoCompleteFamilyName` by finding the view with ID `R.id.auto_complete_family_name`
     * (it is the [AutoCompleteTextView] wrapped by `familyNameInput` which the user uses to choose
     * a font name). We then set hte adapter of `autoCompleteFamilyName` to `adapter` and add an
     * anonymous [TextWatcher] to it whose `onTextChanged` override uses our [isValidFamilyName]
     * method to determine if the text that the user typed in is valid and if it is valid disables
     * the error functionality of `familyNameInput` and clears the error message that will be displayed
     * below its [AutoCompleteTextView] `autoCompleteFamilyName`. If it is invalid the override will
     * enable the error functionality of `familyNameInput` and set the error message that will be
     * displayed below its [AutoCompleteTextView] `autoCompleteFamilyName` to "Not a valid Family
     * Name".
     *
     * Next we initialize our [Button] field [mRequestDownloadButton] by finding the view in our UI
     * with the ID `R.id.button_request` and set its [View.OnClickListener] to a lambda which
     * initializes its [String] variable `val familyName` to the `text` in `autoCompleteFamilyName`.
     * If our [isValidFamilyName] determines that it is not a valid family it enables the error
     * functionality of `familyNameInput` and sets the error message that will be displayed below its
     * [AutoCompleteTextView] `autoCompleteFamilyName` to "Not a valid Family Name" then toasts the
     * message "Invalid inputs exist". If [isValidFamilyName] determines that it is a valid family
     * name the lambda call our method [requestDownload] with `familyName` and disables the
     * [Button] field [mRequestDownloadButton].
     *
     * Finally our [onCreate] override initializes our [CheckBox] field [mBestEffort] by finding the
     * view with ID `R.id.checkbox_best_effort`.
